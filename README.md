# WebShield
> WebShield is an automated website vulnerability scanner that scans a URL for potential threats/vulnerabilities, and helps the user deal with these.
> This project started during the Give-Back Hacks Hackathon 2020.

# How It Works?
> WebShield connects with the [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/api/#introduction) api to scan a URL.  OWASP ZAP is an api that used active scans to find vulnerabilities in webpages that might be exploited.
> WebShield connects to the api in order to scan the URL and retrieve the data.  It then displays this data in a user-friendly way by showing the user the websites vulnerabilities with its details, and how they can be fixed.
