        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur
          when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or
          query. The attacker’s hostile data can trick the interpreter into
          executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper
          authorization.

        Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not
        properly enforced. Attackers can exploit these flaws to access
        unauthorized functionality and/or data, such as access other users’
        accounts, view sensitive files, modify other users’ data, change access
        rights, etc.
